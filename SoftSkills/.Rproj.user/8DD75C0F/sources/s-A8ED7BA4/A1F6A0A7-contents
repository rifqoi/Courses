## Question

Sofia just got accepted as a cloud engineer at a technology company focusing on logistics. She is feeling overwhelmed, as she has so many things to do in her tasklist:

1. Hold a daily maintenance and be on-standby for her shift.
2. Browse and buy a birthday present for her mom, whose birthday is next week.
3. Prepare an infrastructure for data migration to cloud which will help the developer team to update the company’s app due in 3 days.
4. Attend her primary school virtual reunion tonight.
5. Grocery shopping to buy ingredients to prepare a feast for her mother’s birthday held next weekend.
6. Prepare progress reports for the meeting this evening.
7. Catch up with the last 3 episodes of her favorite TV series.
8. Visit the doctor as she feels mild pain on her back after long hours of work recently.

Please help Sofia create a time management quadrant for all of her tasks. Explain why you think each activity should fall into a particular quadrant in a short essay.


## Answer
Time Management Quadrant is a time management framework which classify tasks by their urgency of the matter (is it urgent or not?) and by its importance (is it important or not?).

We, human, tend to do things that we think are the most urgent first. 

```{python, echo=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
data  = {'urgent':[1,2], 'not urgent' : [1,2], 'important': [1,2,], 'not important' : [1,2],}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index(['important', 'not important'])
print(df)
```
